DESCRIPTION

CAM::UserApp provides generic session-based login capabilities.  It
supports login, state maintenance and password changing in a framework
that supports either SOAP or cookie-based HTML, among other
possibilities.

CAM::UserApp is not complete by itself.  Some of its methods must be
implemented by a subclass.  In particular, retrieveUser() must be
supplied.  In an HTML or other human-interaction environment, the
offerLogin() and offerChangePassword() methods should be implemented.
Others are optional, and are described in the documentation.
